# PIGFX.H

This project is to make it easier and more accesible to use [PiGFX](https://github.com/fbergama/pigfx)'s many functions.

This is specifically formatted with Aztec C 1.06d in mind:
* Most functions use 7 characters

  I did this to keep below the 8 character limit
* Most functions begin with `pg`

  This allows you to write similar sounding functions in your own code, and to maintain compatibility with my `conio.h` implementation. Certain functions, like the bitmap functions, do not follow this because I assume you have no other hardware capable of drawing/loading bitmaps in this way.
* Defines and variable declarations are C89 standard
